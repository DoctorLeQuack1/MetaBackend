# Python Typecasting

Python uses different datatypes for processing and allows you to use information effectively. Sometimes, after collecting data in a variable, you may need to change its datatype. For example, consider a scenario where a user submits a form on a website. One of the fields is supposed to contain an integer, but the data is passed as a string. This can be a problem because to perform calculations, the string data must be converted to an integer.

In this tutorial, you will learn about two types of typecasting methods in Python: implicit and explicit typecasting. You will also learn how to use Python functions to apply typecasting.

## What is Typecasting?

Typecasting is the process of converting one datatype into another. Python supports two types of typecasting:

1. **Implicit Typecasting** (Automatic conversion)
2. **Explicit Typecasting** (Manual conversion)

Let's explore both of these in more detail.

### Implicit Typecasting

Implicit typecasting is automatically performed by Python's interpreter when the data types are compatible. For example, Python can automatically convert an `int` to a `float` when needed, to prevent data loss.

#### Example of Implicit Typecasting:
```python
# Implicit conversion from int to float
num = 5       # int
result = num + 5.5  # float
print(result)  # Output: 10.5
```
In the example above, `num` is an integer, but when added to a float (5.5), Python automatically converts `num` to a float.

### Explicit Typecasting

Explicit typecasting, on the other hand, requires the developer to manually convert one datatype into another. Python provides several built-in functions for this purpose. Let's explore some of the most common ones.

#### `str()` Function (Convert to String)

You can use the `str()` function to convert any datatype into a string.

##### Example:
```python
# Convert int to string
num = 10
str_num = str(num)
print(type(str_num))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

#### `int()` Function (Convert to Integer)

The `int()` function is used to convert a number (float or string) into an integer.

##### Example:
```python
# Convert float to int
float_num = 10.99
int_num = int(float_num)
print(int_num)  # Output: 10

# Convert string to int
str_num = "25"
int_num = int(str_num)
print(int_num)  # Output: 25
```

#### `float()` Function (Convert to Float)

You can use the `float()` function to convert a number (int or string) into a float.

##### Example:
```python
# Convert int to float
num = 7
float_num = float(num)
print(float_num)  # Output: 7.0

# Convert string to float
str_num = "3.14"
float_num = float(str_num)
print(float_num)  # Output: 3.14
```

### Other Typecasting Functions

In addition to the `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions, Python offers many other functions for typecasting:

- `ord()` – Returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of a character.
  ```python
  print(ord('A'))  # Output: 65
  ```

- `hex()` – Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.
  ```python
  print(hex(255))  # Output: '0xff'
  ```

- `oct()` – Converts an integer to an octal string.
  ```python
  print(oct(8))  # Output: '0o10'
  ```

- `tuple()` – Converts an iterable to a tuple.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
  print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
  ```

- `set()` – Converts an iterable to a set.
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
  my_set = set(my_list)
  print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
  ```

- `list()` – Converts an iterable to a list.
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  my_list = list(my_tuple)
  print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
  ```

- `dict()` – Converts a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary.
  ```python
  my_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
  my_dict = dict(my_list)
  print(my_dict)  # Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
  ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about typecasting in Python. It's important to remember that data types are not fixed. You can convert data types using the provided Python functions when necessary. Keep in mind that not all data types are compatible for automatic conversion, and you might need to perform explicit typecasting to ensure proper data handling.

Typecasting plays a crucial role in preventing data loss, performing calculations, and making your code more versatile when working with different types of data.
