# Type Casting: A Deeper Look

In Python, there are scenarios where you need to change a value's data type to another type. This process is called **type casting** or **data type conversion**.

## Simple Example of Type Conversion

A very simple example of type conversion is when we compare an integer and a float:

```python
print(10 == 10)
```

In the above code, we are asking Python if the number `10` is equal to the number `10`. Since they are indeed the same value, Python outputs the boolean value `True`.

### Comparing an Integer and a Float

Now, what happens if we compare an integer and a float?

```python
print(10 == 10.00)
```

Again, Python outputs `True`. Although `10` is an integer and `10.00` is a float, Python treats them as equal in value. This is due to **implicit type conversion** where Python automatically converts the integer to a float for comparison.

### Implicit Type Conversion in Operations

When we perform arithmetic operations with an integer and a float, Python performs an implicit conversion of the integer to a float before carrying out the operation.

#### Example:

```python
print(10 + 10.0)
```

Output:
```
20.0
```

In this example, `10` is implicitly converted to a float before being added to `10.0`, resulting in `20.0`.

To confirm the type of the result, we can use the `type()` function:

```python
print(type(10 + 10.0))
```

Output:
```
<class 'float'>
```

As expected, the result is of type `float`.

## Working with User Inputs

Let's look at a small program that takes user input and performs addition:

```python
user_num_1 = input('First number is: ')
user_num_2 = input('Second number is: ')
user_sum = user_num_1 + user_num_2
print(user_sum)
```

If you run this code and input `5` for both numbers, the output will be:

```
55
```

### Why Did This Happen?

Although we input numbers, the `input()` function always returns the data as a string. This means that `user_num_1` and `user_num_2` are actually strings, and when we try to add them, Python concatenates the two strings instead of performing numeric addition.

To fix this, we need to explicitly convert the input values to numbers before performing any operations.

### Explicit Type Conversion

Here's how we can modify the code to convert the input values to numbers:

```python
user_num_1 = input('First number is: ')
user_num_2 = input('Second number is: ')
user_sum = float(user_num_1) + float(user_num_2)
print(user_sum)
```

Now, if you input `5` for both numbers, the output will be:

```
10.0
```

This is because we explicitly convert the input values to floats, allowing the program to perform numeric addition.

## Handling Floats in Input

What if the user enters decimal numbers, like `5.5`? The program will still work as expected because we are converting the inputs to floats:

```python
user_num_1 = input('First number is: ')
user_num_2 = input('Second number is: ')
user_sum = float(user_num_1) + float(user_num_2)
print(user_sum)
```

If the input is `5.5` for both numbers, the output will be:

```
11.0
```

### Concatenating Strings and Floats

Now, let's try to output some words along with the result. Here's an attempt at concatenating the string values:

```python
num_1 = input('First number is: ')
num_2 = input('Second number is: ')
user_sum = float(num_1) + float(num_2)
print("The sum of: " + num_1 + " and " + num_2 + " is " + user_sum)
```

When we run this code, we will get the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
```

This error occurs because Python doesn't allow concatenating a string and a float directly. Even though Python performs implicit type conversion with `+` for numbers, it does not do the same when combining strings and floats.

### Fixing the Concatenation Error

To fix this, we need to explicitly convert the float value back into a string before concatenation:

```python
n1 = input('First number is: ')
n2 = input('Second number is: ')
user_sum = float(n1) + float(n2)
print("The sum of " + str(n1) + " and " + str(n2) + " is " + str(user_sum))
```

Now, if you input `5.5` for both numbers, the output will be:

```
The sum of 5.5 and 5.5 is 11.0
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about type casting in Python. Implicit type conversion happens automatically when compatible types are involved in operations, but when types are incompatible, you need to perform explicit type conversion. This ensures that your program handles data properly, especially when working with user inputs or mixed data types.

As you continue to learn Python, you'll encounter more situations where type casting is necessary, and you'll get more comfortable with performing these conversions explicitly.
